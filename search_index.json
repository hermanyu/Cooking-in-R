[["index.html", "About", " About These notes started notes I had taken while learning R and eventually grew to include statistical learning in R. The notes were written in Rmarkdown files which compiled neatly into HTML pages. While searching for a way to coalesce these notes into a single document, I came across the bookdown and blogdown packages in R. These offered out-of-the-box functionality of turning my Rmarkdown files into a full function e-book that I could host on my personal github. Chapters 1-4 are on base R. These were notes I compiled from a variety of online sources found through Google. Chapters 5-8 are on data analysis using the tidyverse. This portion of the notes follow the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. I took notes on the sections I needed to get started on clean data sets from Kaggle or the UCI machine learning repository. Currently, the plan is to learn data cleaning tools as they become necessary. Chapter 9 onwards deals with modeling. This portion of the notes follow both: Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISLR) by G. James, D. Witten, T. Hastie and R. Tibshirani. Elements of Statistical Learning (ESLR) by T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman. The idea is to use ESLR to establish the theory, then use ISRL to implement the code in R.
